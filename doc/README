Intro
-----
jccoin is a free open source peer-to-peer electronic cash system that is
completely decentralized, without the need for a central server or trusted
parties.  Users hold the crypto keys to their own money and transact directly
with each other, with the help of a P2P network to check for double-spending.


Setup
-----
there is no jccoin-qt. there is a jccoind command-line daemon only.

Unpack the files into a directory and run:
 bin/32/jccoind (headless, 32-bit)
 bin/64/jccoind (headless, 64-bit)
